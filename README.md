# Project Plan
## Inventory manager for a video game

I'm planning to create an inventory system that allows the storage and retrieval of hypothetical video game items.
I plan to use it as a way to see how inventory systems are designed.
This project is of interest to me because I want to create games, and in most games an inventory plays a vital role.

## User Stories

*What the inventory should allow:*
- As a user, I want to be able to add and take items from it
- As a user, I want to be able to inspect items: look at names, descriptions, and values
- As a user, I want to the inventory to display the names of all items and amount of individual items
- As a user, I want to be able to select multiple items and see their collective value
